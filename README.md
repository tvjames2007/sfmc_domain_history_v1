# sfmc_domain_history_v1

This will capture the performance (opens, clicks, ctor, optouts) on a domain-by-domain basis for your top 10 domains.

How I Use This
--------------
I have an Automation that runs weekly to get this information and then emails it to me.

Prerequisites
-------------
Requires a list of domains (with counts) in order to come up with the top 10.  I have another repository that describes how to get that data.
